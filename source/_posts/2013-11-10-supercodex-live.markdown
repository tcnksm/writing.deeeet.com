I went to the world premire live by Ryouji Ikeda at Shibuya WWW. Recently he released his new album "supercodex", it was the last one in his recent trilogy from [Raster-noton](http://www.raster-noton.net/). This live was its releasing party.

It was the best live which I've ever gone. I've never listened such music ( I don't know I can call it music) and watched visual artworks. I was super impressed with its perfection. All sounds and its visual art were constructed from too small flagments and petterm. I can not imagine how many peterns he has and how construct it.

I wathed [cyclo.'s live@TAICOCLUB'11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_38sywJ6U) (cyclo. is unit of Ryouji Ikeda and Carsten Nicolai). Compared with that, this supercodex live set is more hard and aggressive sounds. In artworks, he split the screen right and left, and display different sin or cos wave from up to down.

In an encore, he played ['data.matrix'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5hhFMSAuf4) from "dataplex", it was also cool.
